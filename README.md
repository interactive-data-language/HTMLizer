# HTMLizer

A modern routine for parsing and converting IDL code to HTML with the option to add tooltips and links to the official documentation.

This is a modern replacement to the old extension **idl_to_html**.


## Accuracy

The overall accuracy of highlighting the code with this is extension is pretty good. It will have troubles if you don't follow best practices outlined in the [IDL contributing guide](https://github.com/interactive-data-language/ContribGuide) and if you use goofy syntax that is not easy to read. This does perform better than the official ENVI documentation online for some cases.


## Usage

Here is an example that you can copy/paste into the IDL console once you have the code on IDL's search path. Note that, to speed up processing, an object was used which stores some information about the different routines in IDL. The general idea is to instantiate the object, process multiple files, and then clean up after finished.


```idl
;specify our input file
inputFile = file_which('python__define.pro')

;read in plot.pro
strings = htmlizer_read_file(inputFile)

;initialize the object
html = HTMLizer()

;process some strings
coloredStrings = html.HTMLize(strings, /DOCS_LINKS, /TOOLTIPS)

;clean up
html.cleanup

;make our strings an official HTML file
coloredStrings = $
  ['<html><head><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./idl-styles.css"></head><body>',$
  coloredStrings,$
  '</body></html>']

;set up our output file
outFile = filepath(file_basename(inputFile, '.pro') + '.html', /TMP)

;write to disk
htmlizer_write_file, outFile, coloredStrings

;copy CSS to output directory
htmlizer_copy_css, file_dirname(outFile)

print, 'Output file : ' + outFile
```


## Updating the Routines

In order to update the routines you will need to do two things:

1. Run the routine `htmlizer_export_csv` which will read in the `idl_routines.sav` file and export it to `idl_routines.csv`.

2. Make changes to the `idl_routines.csv` file and then run `htmlizer_import_csv` which will then update `idl_routines.csv`

Take a look at the idl_routines.csv file for what the syntax should be for adding additional rows of information.
